### FACTS

* This token is called MASTERIUM [MTI] and it runs as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
* All Tokens holders earn interest (at high rates) at fixed intervals of approx. 30 days for the next 4 years.
* It's the first "Masternode" token on Ethereum we are aware of. Token holders of 100,000 MTI or more can deposit Ether to the contract and become a Masternode.
* Every Masternode (max. 22) is able to mine / mint 50,000 new MTI-tokens every 30 days for the next 4 years.
* Every token transfer costs a transaction fee (0.01 MTI units) and Masternodes receive all the transaction fees generated by transactions between wallets or exchanges.
* Tokens can be transferred from wallet to wallet without 3rd parties involved. In the future the token will be listed at 3rd-party exchanges to be traded agains other cryptocurrencies.
* Currently we are coding a contract and a web-frontend for an anonymous token exchange with buy- and sellbooks for independently and anonymous exchanging this coin against Ether without the need of 3rd-parties.


### BUSINESS PLAN: LiSM-Project

*  By now this token is intend to be an object of speculation. A bet to the future with the common risks.
*  In a later stage we will pubish our use-case idea for it in detail. But we need to do some research and coding first. We don't want to trick you into any idea without a tested beta-version of our planed business. So at the moment only the token is here and nothing more.
*  In the future this coin is supposed to be the main monetary unit for the LiSM-Project (Instant Online Stock Photo Agency). You can read more about the concept at our Website: http://www.lismresearch.com

####The LiSM-Project in short:

* We intend to develop a platform for photo- and videographers (fun, hobby and professional) to presentate and offer their media (photos / videos) to customers (marketing agencies and private persons) for sale.
* In 2010 it was easy for photographers to earn money by publishing their portfolios at online stock photo agencies. These days are over since years. The marktsegment is flooded with hundreds of boring images in the hope to hit a sell for a few dollars. that's anyoing.
* In 2017 "everyone" in running one of these boring stockphoto platforms with millions of uniform photos and videos without profit.
* They got stuck in the past. That's not the way media works today.
* This segment needs to get mobile ... and stylish. A platform must attract the younger ones to get the required attention at first and try to keep the quality high to be usefull for the professionals. The product must be easy to use and it must be fun to use it.
* We love Instagram. They pushed nearly everything in the right direction, except the quality and the monetarizing factor. It's too much like Twitter: Post, read and forget ... and never find again ... or see the same images / vids 10 times in a row. There is no real usecase for monetizing your media by quality but by follower-counts only.
* We try to merge the two worlds: Fun and (Semi-)Professional-Media-Business.
* The aim is to create an intuitive (and a stylish) stock photography platform, not the old fashioned way, but in the style of Instagram and with multiple ways to directly and indirectly monetise your picture / video-portfolio. We will to try give fun to the users by providing user-interactions, ratings and discussions to the published content.
* There should be no hard upload and reviewing rules for presenting medias in the way the stock agencies try to keep the quality high. Instead we try to establish a quality based rating and voting system to get unusefull or unwanted content blocked.   
* The rewarding and payment structure will be based on Masterium-Coins (and fiat money).
* A publisher should be able to present and maintain a media-portfolio. The users should be able to browse for personal interest or by random. They should be able to rate and comment media-uploads and set favorites. Additionally they should be able to buy pictures and videos (with various lincense models) with fiat and crypto for external sharing or semi- and professional use.
* In the return the publishers should earn money (fiat and crypto) directly for bought content and indirect by ratings, view and share-rates.  
* Compareable to the STEEMIT-concept, media providers (every user who uploads pictures or professional photographers with verified accounts) will be additionally rewarded with tokens if there photos get attention. There will be a rating model implementated ("Favorites", Likes", "Thumbs up / down", "Shares").
* There will be a simple license model, comparable to the one of well established stock photo agencies (Shutterstock, Getty Images, Alamy, Imagepoint, Fotolia, iStockPhoto, ...). The difference will be the payment model. It should be easy to upload pictures and monetise them. Or just to have fun publishing and sharing your media.
* The payment model will be based on the Masterium-Token [MTI]. There will be no separate ICO or any other cryptocurrency created for the LiSM-Project.
* The platform will be designed to run on web and mobile.
* At launch time of the LISM-Project we will buy back up to 30% (and / or use unselled tokens from this ICO) of the available coins to kickstart / advertise the LiSM-Project and be able to payout rewards to uploaders.    
* More details and a deeper proof of concept will be published soon at our Website.

### TOKENSALE ǀ CROWDSALE ǀ INITIAL COIN OFFERING (ICO)

*  There will by a total of only 20'000'000 Tokens created at startup. All Tokens are for sale. No tokens are reserved for us or anyone else.
*  Anyone can buy tokens (at any time, until all 20 Mio. would be sold) with Ethereum from any ERC20-compatible wallet (MyEtherWallet, Ethereum Wallet, Mist, Metamask, ...).
*  No need to register (KYC) your name or E-Mail anywhere to buy tokens. Any participant can send Ether with the "Tokensale Buy Tokens"-contract-function from any erc20-compatible wallet and receive the tokens nearly instant.</p>
*  Use the "Tokensale Buy Tokens"-command from the contract. The tokens will be send to your wallet immediately by the contract itself. Never (you know for sure) send Ether directly from Cryptocurrency Exchanges. The tokens will be credited to the exchange-owner and not your wallet at the exchange.
*  There is a required minimum of 0.0001 ETH to buy Tokens and a participant can spend Ether a buy Tokens for a maximum of 100 ETH per transaction to limit sale-abuse.

Here is a overview of the exchange rates during the tokensale as a function of the already sold tokens:

	* < 1 Mio. tokens sold: 2000 MTI-tokens per 1 ETH == 1 Token costs 0.00050 ETH
	* < 2 Mio. tokens sold: 1000 MTI-tokens per 1 ETH == 1 Token costs 0.00100 ETH

### INTEREST: Monthly Interest Payouts By Token Balance

*  Very high interest rates for token holders (up to 100% after the first 30 days), meaning an early investor would double his investment with the first interest payout.
*  For holding tokens, every contributor receive a monthly interest. The first interest payout is released 30 days after the tokensale started. And than every 30 days (interval) for 4 years. In the first 30 days after the tokensale started, the interest is 100%. Every 30 days your coin balance increase by the active interest rate. The second interest rate will be 80% of the token balance in you wallet. The next one 60%...
*  Overview of al interest rates for
*  the first 12 intervals (1st year 1282.0% per year): 100.00%, 80.00% 60.00% 40.00% 20.00% 10.00% 5.00% 5.00% 3.00% 3.00% 2.00% 1.00%

### MASTERNODES: mining new tokens and receiving transaction fees (0.01 MTI per transaction) as reward

*  There is a maximum of 22 masternodes allowed. A Masternode owner must hold 100,000.00 MTI-Tokens at the wallet-address of his masternode and deposit some Ether to the contract.
*  Masternodes can mine 50,000.00 (50k) new MTI-tokens once every 30 days by calling a special contract-function.
*  Every mining process creates 50,000.00 new MTI-tokens to the masternodes wallet-address. Mining is possible for 48 x 30-days-intervals (for approx. 4 years). So every masternode can mine up to a max. of 2.4 Mio. Masterium-Tokens.
*  Additionally every transaction (coin transfers between wallets or exchanges) costs a transaction fee in coin units. The fee is equally divided between the registered Masternodes as a reward for backing the contract with ether.
*  Every token-holder with a MTI token-balance of 100,000 MTI (or more) can register a masternode. A deposit of Ether must be send from his wallet to the token contract to become a masternode. The Ether is not lost. It is just a deposit and can be withdrawn everytime by the sender (and only by the sender). The required min. token-balance of 100,000.00 MTI will be freezed for transfers as long as this address is registered as a masternode.
*  The first participant needs to deposit 1 Ether to register a Masternode. The second needs 4 Ether, the third 9 Ether, and so on (numMasternodes^2), until the (theoretical) maximum of 22 allowed Masternodes (deposit: 529 Ether) is reached.
*  In the beginning the masternode rewards, generated by transaction-fees, will be low but should explode if the token hits exchanges.

```
* Click "access"
* Select the function: "Tokensale Buy Tokens"
* Attn.: You can also buy tokens by sending Ether directly to the contract. Set the GAS-Limit to 500,000 or more or the transaction will fail.
* Choose an amount of ETH to spend (between 0.0001 ETH to 100 ETH)
* Tokens will be send to your wallet by the active exchange rate
* The first 1 Mio tokens will be sold at a rate of 2000 MTI-Tokens per 1 Ether

##### To Register A Masternode:
* Login to your myetherwallet.com (or any other compatible wallet)
* Requirement: Hold a token balance of 100,000 MTI (or more) at your wallet-address
* Go to the "contract" section
* Enter this contract address
* Copy and paste this ABI ǀ JSON Interface code
* Click "access"
* Search the public contract variable: "Masternode MinBalanceRequiredInEther"
* Select the function: "Masternode Register"
* Send the required amount of ether from your wallet-address at which you are holding 100,000.00 MTI (or more)
* Wait a minute
* Check the public variables again
* Search for: "isValidMasternode" and enter your wallet address you send the Ether from
* On success the result shows: TRUE
* A balance of 100,000.00 MTI will be freezed and can not be moved to another account as long as this address is registered as a masternode.

##### To Mine Tokens As A Masternode:
* Open your ERC-20 compatibe Ethereum Wallet (address of masternode).
* Call the contract function "Masternode Mine Tokens".
* You can call this functions once every new interest-interval (every 30 days). Check the variable "IntervalNow".
* Wait a minute and check your accounts balance. It should have increased by 50,000.00 tokens.
* Repeat this steps every 30 days. After 48 intervals (4 years from tokensale start) the mining period ends.

##### To Deregister A Masternode:
* Same as above but
* Select a function: "Masternode Deregister" (from your wallet address you registered the masternode)
* Wait a minute
* Check the public variables again
* Search for: "isValidMasternode" and enter your wallet address you send the Ether from
* On success the result shows: FALSE
* Your wallet will be credited with the Ether you previously send
* The token balance of 100,000.00 MTI will be unfreezed

##### To Send Tokens From Your Wallet To Another
* Select the function: "Transfer"
* Enter the amount and the target address
* A additional fee of 0.01 MTI will subtracted from your accounts balance


### TECHNICAL STUFF

The Ethereum contract is coded in Solidity and compiled with Remix Compiler Version 0.4.18.

It introduces a completly new algorithm for calulating compound interest at fixed payout intervals.
On every balance request the compound interest is calculated in realtime from the last known account-balance.
On every gas costy operation (a transaction) the compound interest is credited to the last fixed balance to save cpu-cycles during the next realtime interest calculations.

The masternode stuff is based on the idea of the classic masternodes by rewarding masternode-owners for their thrust.
A classic masternode reward the owners by their service (mixing, stabalizing the chain, ...)
In the Ethereum Ecosystem there is no need for stabalizing the chain, and no effective way for anonymizing transactions.
As a result the masternode feature is more a motivation carrier for holding tokens and advertising the token to profit from transaction-fees.
The mining of additional tokens is an active process for masternode owners. Every masternode owner must activly request the new tokens, once every month. In return, the mining rewards are very high, resulting in good profit.

The token can be used for various uses cases in which token holders should be honored with divident or interest payments at a fixed or variable timeinterval without the need of manual interaction by the contract owner.
It should be fine to kickstart a buisiness with this token and motivate the users to hold the token for a long time to stabilize the price.
The masternode feature should motivate the masternode holders for advertizing the coin to maximize their profit.

Everone is welcome to fork the sourcecode, modify, rename and publish without any licence limitations.

In the following development stages we will publish a web-frontend for user friendly accessing the contract and and independent token/ether-exchange.

### SECURITY
* By definition the Masterium contract is unchangable with the release on the Ethereum-Blockchain.
* After token sale starts we can't control the the main function of contract by design (check the sourcecode).
* If something goes wrong (maybe bugs in the code), it will happend and can't be undone by us.
* We tested the contract in many ways before release, but how knows...
* You can tested the contract before release on the ropsten test network.


### ANONYMITY

The cryptoworld is getting from "underground" to "public". There are many unclear regulation states (KYC, AML, Securities) at the moment.

As a result, and by conviction, we (try) to remain our anonymity (until we get DOXED) as long as possible. But at the end, we have nothing to hide.

In the return you can buy (and trade) tokens without (for what reason ever) providing your identity. That's might be a quality for you these days, ... or not.

If you wanna buy tokens the anonymous way, this is one way to go:
* buy bitcoins with fiat
* fire up your VPN
* create some more bitcoin wallets
* mix them with a bitcoin mixer (i.e. coinmixer.se)
* create an online monero wallet
* exchange your bitcoins to monero with a No-KYC provider (i.e. changelly.com). They request just an e-mail. And this e-mail must **not** be a valid one.
* create an second online monero wallet
* send a part of your monero from the frist wallet to the second one with a high mixing rate
* create a new ethereum wallet (ERC20-compatible)
* exchange your monero to ethereum with a No-KYC provider again (maybe: cryptonator.com).
* send the ether directy to the Masterium-Contract address or (better) use the "tokensaleBuyTokens"-function. The tokens will be send to your wallet by the contract automatically.
* check the amount of received tokens in your ethereum wallet.


### BASHING

######F*#k you all fork and fake ICO-initiators with your blown up to the max campains, promising nothing less than the biggest thing in the world, just there to trick investors and run with their money. F*#k these airdrop- and giveaway-campains to generate value from nothing, for nothing, just to drop your premine at an exchange. And another sweet "F*#k you" to us, too.


###### Sorry for this wired ICO. This market segment is promising (kickstarter for crypto) but needs to get back to the ground. It should not be just all about this wannabe shine and glamour. What do you think? Discuss it with us... any proposals or criticisms are welcome. And yes: We Are Unserious By Vocation ...
