### FACTS

* This token is called MASTERIUM [MTI] and it runs as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
* All Tokens holders earn interest (at high rates) at fixed intervals of approx. 30 days for the next 4 years.
* It's the first "Masternode" token on Ethereum we are aware of. Token holders of 100,000 MTI or more can deposit Ether to the contract and become a Masternode.
* Every Masternode (max. 22) is able to mine / mint 50,000 new MTI-tokens every 30 days for the next 4 years.
* Every token transfer costs a transaction fee (0.01 MTI units) and Masternodes receive all the transaction fees generated by transactions between wallets or exchanges.
* Tokens can be transferred from wallet to wallet without 3rd parties involved. In the future the token will be listed at 3rd-party exchanges to be traded agains other cryptocurrencies.

### TOKENSALE ǀ CROWDSALE ǀ INITIAL COIN OFFERING (ICO)

*  There will by a total of only 20'000'000 Tokens created at startup. All Tokens are for sale. No tokens are reserved for us or anyone else.
*  Anyone can buy tokens (at any time, until all 20 Mio. would be sold) with Ethereum from any ERC20-compatible wallet (MyEtherWallet, Ethereum Wallet, Mist, Metamask, ...).
*  No need to register (KYC) your name or E-Mail anywhere to buy tokens. Any participant can send Ether with the "Tokensale Buy Tokens"-contract-function from any erc20-compatible wallet and receive the tokens nearly instant.</p>
*  Use the "Tokensale Buy Tokens"-command from the contract. The tokens will be send to your wallet immediately by the contract itself. Never (you know for sure) send Ether directly from Cryptocurrency Exchanges. The tokens will be credited to the exchange-owner and not your wallet at the exchange.
*  There is a required minimum of 0.0001 ETH to buy Tokens and a participant can spend Ether a buy Tokens for a maximum of 100 ETH per transaction to limit sale-abuse.

Here is a overview of the exchange rates during the tokensale as a function of the already sold tokens:

### INTEREST: Monthly Interest Payouts By Token Balance

*  Very high interest rates for token holders (up to 100% after the first 30 days), meaning an early investor would double his investment with the first interest payout.
*  For holding tokens, every contributor receive a monthly interest. The first interest payout is released 30 days after the tokensale started. And than every 30 days (interval) for 4 years. In the first 30 days after the tokensale started, the interest is 100%. Every 30 days your coin balance increase by the active interest rate. The second interest rate will be 80% of the token balance in you wallet. The next one 60%...

*  the first 12 intervals (1st year 1282.0% per year): 100.00%, 80.00% 60.00% 40.00% 20.00% 10.00% 5.00% 5.00% 3.00% 3.00% 2.00% 1.00%

### MASTERNODES: mining new tokens and receiving transaction fees (0.01 MTI per transaction) as reward

*  There is a maximum of 22 masternodes allowed. A Masternode owner must hold 100,000.00 MTI-Tokens at the wallet-address of his masternode and deposit some Ether to the contract.
*  Masternodes can mine 50,000.00 (50k) new MTI-tokens once every 30 days by calling a special contract-function.
*  Every mining process creates 50,000.00 new MTI-tokens to the masternodes wallet-address. Mining is possible for 48 x 30-days-intervals (for approx. 4 years). So every masternode can mine up to a max. of 2.4 Mio. Masterium-Tokens.
*  Additionally every transaction (coin transfers between wallets or exchanges) costs a transaction fee in coin units. The fee is equally divided between the registered Masternodes as a reward for backing the contract with ether.
*  Every token-holder with a MTI token-balance of 100,000 MTI (or more) can register a masternode. A deposit of Ether must be send from his wallet to the token contract to become a masternode. The Ether is not lost. It is just a deposit and can be withdrawn everytime by the sender (and only by the sender). The required min. token-balance of 100,000.00 MTI will be freezed for transfers as long as this address is registered as a masternode.
*  The first participant needs to deposit 1 Ether to register a Masternode. The second needs 4 Ether, the third 9 Ether, and so on (numMasternodes^2), until the (theoretical) maximum of 22 allowed Masternodes (deposit: 529 Ether) is reached.
*  In the beginning the masternode rewards, generated by transaction-fees, will be low but should explode if the token hits exchanges.


### TECHNICAL STUFF

The Ethereum contract is coded in Solidity and compiled with Remix Compiler Version 0.4.18.

It introduces a completly new algorithm for calulating compound interest at fixed payout intervals.
On every balance request the compound interest is calculated in realtime from the last known account-balance.
On every gas costy operation (a transaction) the compound interest is credited to the last fixed balance to save cpu-cycles during the next realtime interest calculations.

The masternode stuff is based on the idea of the classic masternodes by rewarding masternode-owners for their thrust.
A classic masternode reward the owners by their service (mixing, stabalizing the chain, ...)
In the Ethereum Ecosystem there is no need for stabalizing the chain, and no effective way for anonymizing transactions.
As a result the masternode feature is more a motivation carrier for holding tokens and advertising the token to profit from transaction-fees.
The mining of additional tokens is an active process for masternode owners. Every masternode owner must activly request the new tokens, once every month. In return, the mining rewards are very high, resulting in good profit.

The token can be used for various uses cases in which token holders should be honored with divident or interest payments at a fixed or variable timeinterval without the need of manual interaction by the contract owner.
It should be fine to kickstart a buisiness with this token and motivate the users to hold the token for a long time to stabilize the price.
The masternode feature should motivate the masternode holders for advertizing the coin to maximize their profit.

Everone is welcome to fork the sourcecode, modify, rename and publish without any licence limitations.

In the following development stages we will publish a web-frontend for user friendly accessing the contract and and independent token/ether-exchange.
